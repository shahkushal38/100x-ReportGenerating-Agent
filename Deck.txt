Slide 1 : Problem

Subtitle - Build a Report Generating Agent using Llama Index

Problem Statement
In a data-driven world, generating clear and concise reports from raw (structured/unstructured) data is a repetitive and time-consuming task. Further it is even more time consuming to customize reports, selecting specific data ranges, filtering criteria, or choose visualizations.

Challenges 
- Managing large datasets efficiently without performance degradation.
- Detecting and analyzing relationships or trends in complex structured data.
- Crafting clear and human-readable text summarizing insights and aesthetically pleasing charts, graphs, and tables in a way that is understandable to non-technical users.


Slide 2 - Solution

Subtitle: An AI powered intelligent Reporting agent

Solution Overview:
We have developed an AI powered intelligent agent that can analyze structured and unstructured data, extract meaningful insights, and generate customizable reports in natural language. The agent is able to handle different input formats (e.g., Excel, CSV, JSON, or databases) and provide user-friendly options for report customization

Unique value proposition:
- seamless integration with external data sources (APIs, cloud storage, databases).
- Parsing and standardizing data from various formats (Excel, CSV, JSON, databases) while ensuring no loss of information.
- Accurately identifying key insights from unstructured data, such as text, while maintaining context.
- Customizing analysis based on domain knowledge (e.g., finance, healthcare) to make insights more relevant.

Benefits:
- 73% of companies struggle to turn data into actionable insights. This system can eliminate that barrier by providing ready-to-use insight and improve decision-making
- Users can generate 10-15 different types of charts and graphs, including bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, etc.
- Eliminates up to 90% of human errors associated with manual data analysis and reporting.
- Unlike manual processes, the system scales effortlessly to handle up to 10x the data volume without proportional cost increases.

SLide 6 - Future Projections

If sufficient capital and time are invested into solving the problem of building an intelligent, customizable report-generating agent, it could evolve into a highly scalable, impactful, and profitable AI-powered reporting ecosystem

1) Market Penetration: The global business intelligence (BI) and analytics software market was valued at $30 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $55 billion by 2030 (CAGR ~9.2%). A mature system could capture 2%-5% of this market, equating to annual revenues of $1-$2.75 billion.

2) Customer Base: By targeting mid-sized businesses, the platform could serve 200,000-500,000 paying customers globally.

3) An Industry-Agnostic Tool: The platform could cater to industries like healthcare, finance, retail, education, manufacturing, and logistics, providing domain-specific insights.

4) Real-Time Insights Hub: With advanced AI (e.g., LLMs like LLama Index), the platform could evolve into a real-time decision-making hub with capabilities like:

Predictive analytics for future trends.
Prescriptive analytics offering actionable recommendations.
Multilingual support for global users.

The global AI market is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030. As a player in this market, a well-built reporting system could capture $500 million-$1 billion annually in value by offering industry-focused AI solutions.
